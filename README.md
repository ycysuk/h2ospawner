## Features ##

spawning h2o flow.

This simple project do 2 things:

1. override *get_args()*, add param so that the url matches
'''
'--context_path=/user/%s' % self.user.name
'''
2. write a java wrapper which using *getopt* to convert args style
'''

'''

## Requirements ##

same as systemdspawner


## Installation ##

You can install it from src with:

```bash
pip install h2ospawner.zip
```

You can enable it for your jupyterhub with the following lines in your
`jupyterhub_config.py` file

```python
c.JupyterHub.spawner_class = 'h2ospawner.H2OSpawner'
```

## Configuration ##

Modify `jupyterhub_config.py` file:

```python
c.Spawner.cmd = ['/[somewhere]/h2o.sh', '/[somewhere]/h2o.jar']
```

In order to avoid slow init of h2o which leads to a timeout err, maybe you should also set timeout a larger value:

```python
c.Spawner.http_timeout = 300  # default value 30
```
